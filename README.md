# Interactive Dweet.me bash shell!

This script is intended to help folks dip their toes into sending receiving dweets from the server. It's meant to be interactive only, so if you're looking to get a bit more programmatic then take a look at the curl syntax in the script itself for pointers. 

Enjoy!

## Requirements
Needs curl installed, prefer that jq is installed as well but not mandatory. We use jq to clean up the returned json objects from topic reads. And bash.
